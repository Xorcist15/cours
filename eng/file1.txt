1. After analyzing the charts, generally people tend to prefer in person communication, then texting and after that phone calls and emails.
It is worth noting that social media and video calls are the least preferred means of communication.

2. Age gaps may have somewhat of a difference on the way people prefer to comminicate, we see that younger generation (code gen z), prefer texting more than phone calls and emails, while older people prefer phone calls and emails over texting.

3. Personally, my favourite way to communicate is in person, and then texts, I don't like phone calls all that much. Video chatting can be fun with friends and with family, i don't use social media at all it is eliminated from the list and i think email are my least favourite means of communication because of the proffesionalism associated.

4. People spend 3+ hours checking their work emails while only 1h30 are spent checking personal emails on off days. 

5. On off days
  for work emails
    30% of people never check their work emails,
    40% of people check their work emails every a few hours
    10% of people check their work emails every hour  
    12% multiple times an hour
    6%  check their emails constantly (nerds)

  for personal emails
    11% never check their emails
    51% check every few hours
    16% every hour
    14% multiple times an hour
    and 8% would check their emails constantly

People tend to check their personal emails more often.

6. in my opinion, people checking their personal emails inside of work and/or their professional emails outside of working hours is not uncommon. Humans tend to get distracted of what they are doing at the moment so they start looking for a small escape of current situation even if it is only for a few minutes by checking emails.
